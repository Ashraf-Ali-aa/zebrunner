It is integrated by default with carina-core open source framework and uses Jenkins as a CI Tool. QPS-Infra is built on top of popular docker solutions, it includes Postgres database, Zebrunner Insights - former Zafira Reporting Tool, Jenkins Master/Slaves Nodes, Selenium Hub, SonarQube, RabbitMQ, etc. In additions it is easily intergated with 3rd party devices/browsers cloud providers like: Zebrunner Engine , MCloud , Browserstack , SauceLabs etc All components are deployed under NGiNX WebServer which can be configured in a fully secured environment QPS-Infra and its subcomponents all together can be used as an effective Test Automation infrastructure for test automation development, execution, management, etc. Purpose Welcome to the QPS-Infra Tutorial. This manual is designed to help you install, configure and maintain your system, and to optimize and extend or re-configure it to meet the changing needs of your business. In short, the aim of this manual is to explain the tasks involved in administering QPS-Infra system Audience This guide is written for all levels of administrators, from those who is responsible for deployment and setup, to those who oversee the entire system and its usage. In addition, some information from User Guide is intended for TestOps engineers who want to build effective Test Automation process and follow best practices. Assumed Knowledge Installation and Configuration guides are for administrators who install, deploy and Manage QPS-Infra products. It assumes the following knowledge: Docker platform and docker compose orchestration tool skills UNIX/Linux administration skills Security and server administration skills Understanding of your organization's security infrastructure, including authentication providers such as LDAP, and use of SSL Understanding of your organization's network environment and port usage User guide is for TestOps engineers who develop test automation scenarios, execute and maintain them etc. It assumes the following knowledge: Preferable Test Automation language and framework.

To start there are a number of additional parameters that can be added to an existing Test Suite xml. These parameters are: jenkinsJobName - This property is just the name that Jenkins should create a job for, the normal pattern here is to include the platform name in the job itself to make it easier to find inside of Jenkins. jenkinsJobType \u2013 This property tells Jenkins what type of job it is. This field can take a \u201cweb\u201d or \u201capi\u201d value. If value set to \u201capi\u201d \u2013 Jenkins knows that there is no need to use web browser for run this Test Suite. If value set to \u201cweb\u201d \u2013 Jenkins will use web browser to run the Test. Chrome browser will be used by default. jenkinsEmail - This property takes a comma separated list of emails/distribution lists that end results of a Test Suite will be emailed to. jenkinsFailedEmail - This property takes a comma separated list of emails/distribution lists that end results of a Test Suite that contains failures will be emailed to. jenkinsRegressionPipeline - This property takes a comma separated string of the various pipelines that a specific Test Suite will be attached to. (i.e. nightly_regression_cron, full_regression_cron). This would end up creating two pipeline jobs inside of Jenkins. jenkinsEnvironments - This property takes a comma separated string of the various environments that will be tested for that particular suite. (i.e. PROD, QA,DEV,STAGE,BETA, etc...) jenkinsPipelineEnvironments - This property takes a comma separated string of the various environments that will be tested for a particular suite in a particular pipeline (i.e. PROD,QA,DEV,STAGE) jenkinsJobExecutionOrder - This property takes a number value and allows for a pipeline to be generated which will run tests in a sequential synchronous manner, compared to the default asynchronous manner. jenkinsJobExecutionMode -This property is only consumed when a jenkinsJobExecutionOrder has been set on a pipeline which would put that pipeline into a synchronous mode and takes a value of \"continue\". When that is specified if a prior job has had an error while running the next job in sequence will still pick up and run instead of halting the entire pipeline. jenkinsRegressionMatrix - This property we use for creating configuration test matrix. overrideFields - This property takes any number of custom fields that need to be available at run-time for a job to run successfully. Test Jobs (API/Web/Mobile) Jenkins Pipeline Job - this is a job that can be created for each suite and can be executed on demand or by schedule.

You will see \"Job1\" Job after Scan is finished (automatic or manual). Run a Job Steps: Login to Jenkins Go to organization/repository and open a Job Click Build with Parameters and run Build When Job is Completed analyze published reports/logs (Carina reports/Zafira reports/TestNG reports) Schedule a Job Open TestNG suite xml file Fill the bunch of necessary parameters in your xml if they are absent: <parameter name=\"scheduling\" value=\"H 2 * * *\" /> Note: As a value provide regular Jenkins Cron expression.To prganize multiple schedules use \"\\n\" as separator: <parameter name=\"scheduling\" value=\"H 2 * * *\\nH 10 * * *\" /> Commit and merge.

Run a Cron Steps: Go to organization/repository and open a Cron Job Note: There is a \"CRON\" view for such kind of jobs Click Build with Parameters and run Build Cron Job should trigger children jobs according to desired configuration matrix When Cron Job is Completed analyze children jobs' reports/logs (Carina reports/Zafira reports/TestNG reports) Schedule a Cron Open any child TestNG suite xml file Declare \"jenkinsRegressionScheduling\" parameter : <parameter name=\"jenkinsRegressionPipeline\" value=\"Carina-Demo-Regression-Pipeline\"/> <parameter name=\"jenkinsRegressionScheduling\" value=\"H 2 * * *\" /> Commit and merge.
